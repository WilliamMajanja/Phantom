## 🌌 THE NEURAL CORE
**PHANTOM** is a tactical, AI-native digital audio workstation designed for resilient creative output in any environment. By merging high-fidelity synthesis with decentralized communication protocols and blockchain provenance, PHANTOM exists where the cloud meets the dirt.

It is built to run on edge hardware (like the Raspberry Pi 5) while leveraging the power of Gemini 3 Flash for neural pattern generation and the Minima blockchain for immutable asset tracking.

### ⚡ Key Technologies
*   **ShadowCore Engine**: Real-time 32-bit float audio processing with zero-latency signal paths and parallel stem isolation.
*   **GhostBridge V3**: Neural pattern synthesis powered by Gemini 3 Flash, supporting multi-line tactical commands and MIDI exfiltration.
*   **Hive Protocol**: Peer-to-peer LoRa Mesh networking for voice and data sync across nodes via WebSockets.
*   **Spirit Ledger**: Immutable session anchoring via Minima Omnia and unique asset tokenization via Minima Axia.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT & SETUP

PHANTOM is a full-stack application utilizing an Express backend and a Vite-powered React frontend.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18+ recommended.
- **Gemini API Key**: Required for Ghost Bridge neural synthesis.
- **Minima Node**: (Optional) For blockchain provenance features.

### 📦 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/infinity-collaborations/phantom.git
cd phantom

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### ⚙️ Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see `.env.example`):
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### ⚡ Launch
```bash
# Engage the core in development mode
npm run dev
```
> **Access Point:** `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎛️ OPERATOR INTERFACE

### 🧠 Ghost Bridge (AI Neural Link)
The Ghost Bridge is your neural link to the machine. Use the command console to summon complex patterns or chat with the "Ghost in the Machine."

*   **Tactical Commands**:
    *   `/GENERATE` - Create a new rhythmic foundation from scratch.
    *   `/REMIX` - Re-interpret current instrumentation with new rhythms.
    *   `/MUTATE` - Apply subtle variations to the active pattern.
    *   `/EVOLVE` - Gradually increase signal complexity and intensity.
    *   `/CLEAR` - Wipe the sequencer grid.
*   **MIDI Exfiltration**: Every pattern generated by the AI can be exported as a Standard MIDI File (Format 0), specifically mapped for the **Roland TR-8S** drum machine.

### 💎 Prism Deck (Sampling & Stems)
*   **Stem Isolation**: Real-time parallel crossover engine to split any signal into Vocals, Drums, Bass, and Other.
*   **Flux FX**: Performance-grade Loop Rollers, Stutter gates, and EQ filters for high-intensity transitions.

### 🛡️ Safety & Security
*   **Panic Watchdog**: Real-time telemetry monitoring CPU thermals, NPU load, and memory usage.
*   **Kill Switch**: Instant signal blackout and data purge protocol for compromised environments.

## 🔗 BLOCKCHAIN PROVENANCE

PHANTOM integrates deeply with the **Minima Blockchain** to ensure your creative output is tracked and owned.

### ⚓ Omnia Anchoring
Anchor your entire session state to the blockchain. PHANTOM generates a cryptographic "Spirit Hash" of your current patterns, parameters, and telemetry, then anchors it to a Minima block. This creates an immutable record of your creative process.

### 💎 Axia Tokenization
Mint unique audio patterns as digital assets. Using the Axia protocol, you can create a unique token on the Minima chain that represents a specific pattern, complete with its metadata and provenance hash.

## 📡 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

PHANTOM nodes communicate via a multi-layered protocol stack designed for reliability in disconnected environments.

| Layer | Protocol | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HIVE** | WebSocket / LoRa | Real-time voice-over-mesh and peer discovery. |
| **RELAY** | Radio RF (Simulated) | Frequency-hopped text messenger and signal relay. |
| **PHANTOM** | Custom Binary | High-speed local cluster synchronization for audio sync. |

---

## 🛠️ HARDWARE FORGE
While the web simulation is powerful, PHANTOM is designed for the **Raspberry Pi 5**.
*   **Compute**: 8GB RAM + NVMe SSD for high-speed sample access.
*   **AI**: Hailo-8L NPU for local stem separation (Prism Core).
*   **Audio**: I2S DAC for low-jitter, high-fidelity output.
*   **Comms**: Waveshare LoRa Module for mesh networking.
