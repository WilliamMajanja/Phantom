## 🌌 THE NEURAL CORE
**PHANTOM** is not just a DAW; it's a tactical instrument designed for resilient creative output in any environment. By merging high-fidelity synthesis with decentralized communication protocols, PHANTOM exists where the cloud meets the dirt.

### ⚡ Key Technologies
*   **ShadowCore Engine**: Real-time 32-bit float audio processing with zero-latency signal paths.
*   **GhostBridge V2**: Neural pattern synthesis powered by Gemini 3 Flash, supporting multi-line tactical commands.
*   **Hive Protocol**: Peer-to-peer LoRa Mesh networking for voice and data sync across nodes.
*   **Spirit Ledger**: Immutable session anchoring via the Minima Blockchain.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT
Launch the workstation in your local simulation environment.

```bash
# Clone and enter the sector
git clone https://github.com/infinity-collaborations/phantom.git
cd phantom

# Initialize modules
npm install

# Engage the core
npm run dev
```
> **Access Point:** `http://localhost:3000`

## 📡 TACTICAL COMMS
PHANTOM nodes communicate via a multi-layered protocol stack designed for reliability.

| Module | Protocol | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HIVE** | LoRa Mesh (915MHz) | Real-time voice-over-mesh and peer discovery. |
| **RELAY** | Radio RF | Frequency-hopped text messenger and signal relay. |
| **BRIDGE** | WebSocket | High-speed local cluster synchronization. |

## 🎛️ OPERATOR INTERFACE

### 🧠 Ghost Bridge (AI)
The Ghost Bridge is your neural link to the machine. Use the command console to summon complex patterns:
*   `/GENERATE` - Create a new rhythmic foundation.
*   `/REMIX` - Re-interpret current instrumentation.
*   `/EVOLVE` - Gradually increase signal complexity.
*   *Example:* `"Summon a dark industrial rumble at 140bpm with bit-crushed snares."*

### 💎 Prism Deck (Sampling)
*   **Stem Isolation**: Real-time parallel crossover engine to split any signal into Vocals, Drums, and Bass.
*   **Flux FX**: Performance-grade Loop Rollers and Stutter gates for high-intensity transitions.

### 🛡️ Safety & Security
*   **Dead Man's Switch**: A physical/software safety hatch (GPIO 17) for instant signal blackout.
*   **Panic Watchdog**: Real-time telemetry monitoring CPU thermals and NPU load.

---

## 🛠️ HARDWARE FORGE
While the web simulation is powerful, PHANTOM is built for the **Raspberry Pi 5**.
*   **Compute**: 8GB RAM + NVMe SSD.
*   **AI**: Hailo-8L NPU for local stem separation.
*   **Audio**: I2S DAC for low-jitter output.
